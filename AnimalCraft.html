                    The Japanese macaque (/məˈkɑːk/; Macaca fuscata), 
                also known as the snow monkey, is a terrestrial Old World 
                monkey species that is native to Japan. They get their name 
                "snow monkey" because they live in areas where snow covers 
                the ground for months each year – no other nonhuman primate 
                is more northern-living, nor lives in a colder climate.
                Individuals have brown-grey fur, red faces, and short tails. 
                Two subspecies are known.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Japan, the species is known as Nihonzaru 
                (Nihon 日本 "Japan" + saru 猿 "monkey") to distinguish it from 
                other primates, but the Japanese macaque is very familiar in 
                Japan, so when Japanese people simply say saru, they usually 
                have in mind the Japanese macaque.

                    The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, 
                most recognizable for their pattern of dark vertical stripes 
                on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside.
                The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, 
                leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, 
                primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They 
                are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, 
                often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support 
                their prey requirements. This, coupled with the fact that they 
                are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on 
                Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.

                    Tigers are among the most recognisable and popular of the world's 
                charismatic megafauna. They have featured prominently in ancient 
                mythology and folklore, and continue to be depicted in modern 
                films and literature. They appear on many flags, coats of arms, 
                and as mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the national 
                animal of Bangladesh, India, Malaysia and South Korea.
