                    The Japanese macaque (/məˈkɑːk/; Macaca fuscata), 
                also known as the snow monkey, is a terrestrial Old World 
                monkey species that is native to Japan. They get their name 
                "snow monkey" because they live in areas where snow covers 
                the ground for months each year – no other nonhuman primate 
                is more northern-living, nor lives in a colder climate.
                Individuals have brown-grey fur, red faces, and short tails. 
                Two subspecies are known.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Japan, the species is known as Nihonzaru 
                (Nihon 日本 "Japan" + saru 猿 "monkey") to distinguish it from 
                other primates, but the Japanese macaque is very familiar in 
                Japan, so when Japanese people simply say saru, they usually 
                have in mind the Japanese macaque.

                    The Tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, 
                most recognizable for their pattern of dark vertical stripes 
                on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside.
                The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, 
                leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, 
                primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They 
                are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, 
                often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support 
                their prey requirements. This, coupled with the fact that they 
                are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on 
                Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.

                    Tigers are among the most recognisable and popular of the world's 
                charismatic megafauna. They have featured prominently in ancient 
                mythology and folklore, and continue to be depicted in modern 
                films and literature. They appear on many flags, coats of arms, 
                and as mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the national 
                animal of Bangladesh, India, Malaysia and South Korea.

                    The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, literally "black and 
                white cat-foot"; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dà xióng māo, literally 
                "big bear cat"), also known as panda bear or simply panda, 
                is a bear native to south central China. It is easily 
                recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around 
                its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name 
                "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the 
                unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, 
                the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. Giant pandas in 
                the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or 
                even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In 
                captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub 
                leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared 
                food.
            </p>
            <p>
                    The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, 
                mainly in Sichuan province, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and 
                Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other 
                development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland 
                areas where it once lived.

                    Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group 
                of aquatic, flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the 
                Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, 
                found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, 
                penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their 
                wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, 
                fish, squid and other forms of sealife caught while swimming 
                underwater. They spend about half of their lives on land and half 
                in the oceans.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern 
                Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as 
                Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far 
                south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, and one 
                species, the Galápagos penguin, lives near the equator.
